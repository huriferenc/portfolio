    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Since 2013, I have been involved in programming and web development, especially HTML, HTML5,
      CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL-based technologies, and for a while I also developed
      C#-based .NET softwares.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of my previous work I have considered it important to work accurately,
      precisely, and to focus on customer-centric work. Good teamwork is essential to me. Thanks to
      my ability to integrate, my relationship with my colleagues was always good. To my work I'm
      loyal and with my knowledge I'm involved in the achievement of the set goals. In any situation
      I can find a solution and handle it properly. For my clients, I am always patient,
      understanding and helpful, and I have performed them with the utmost care and precision.
